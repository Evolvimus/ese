If the situation warrants we’ll work with you and your host on a solution.\nNote before contacting us: Please don’t send us legal takedown orders or threats, we don’t actually host every WordPress blog in the world. If you don’t understand that, you probably shouldn’t be sending legal notices anyway.\n\n# Be Listed on This Page\nWe’ll be looking at this list several times a year, so keep an eye out for us re-opening the survey for hosts to submit themselves for inclusion. Listing is completely arbitrary, but includes criteria like: contributions to WordPress.org, size of customer base, ease of WP auto-install and auto-upgrades, avoiding GPL violations, design, tone, historical perception, using the correct logo, capitalizing WordPress correctly, not blaming us if you have a security issue, and up-to-date system software.\n - About\n - News\n - Hosting\n - Privacy\n - Showcase\n - Themes\n - Plugins\n - Patterns\n - Learn\n - Documentation\n - Developers\n - WordPress.tv ↗\n - Get Involved\n - Events\n - Donate ↗\n - Five for the Future\n - WordPress.com ↗\n - Matt ↗\n - bbPress ↗\n - BuddyPress ↗\n - Visit our X (formerly Twitter) account\n - Visit our Bluesky account\n - Visit our Mastodon account\n - Visit our Threads account\n - Visit our Facebook page\n - Visit our Instagram account\n - Visit our LinkedIn account\n - Visit our TikTok account\n - Visit our YouTube channel\n - Visit our Tumblr account",
