      "content_markdown": "# Matt Mullenweg\n\n# Unlucky in Cards\nThe Wall Street Journal has a fun article about the Nex Playground, The Hottest Toy of the Year Is Made by a Tech Startup You’ve Never Heard Of. I think this is the first time one of Audrey Capital’s companies (we invested when it was the Homecourt app) is the hot Christmas item. Here’s it on Amazon, though it looks like it doesn’t ship before Christmas right now.\n\n# Apple iWeb\nThe new X/Twitter algorithim is hard to predict, but I’ve had one go viral with over a million views now, a quote-tweet of a cool demo video of Apple’s website builder from 2009, with themes and blog support and everything. Interesting to compare its interface to Gutenberg and WordPress today.\nWe don’t even know how to build this anymore. https://t.co/Y21FIwVIft\nFor the video to play on the webpage, you have to visit in Safari.\nThe colors here have now gone blue for winter, and snow has started, thanks to the excellent Snow Fall plugin. I also wanted to congratulate Wealthfront on their IPO. Many on their team have been friends or advisors over the years, from David Fortunato responding to my email about their WordPress blog being on an old version when they launched, to the amazing Adam Nash who teaches CS 007 Personal Finance for Engineers at Stanford, and he now runs the awesome Daffy donor-advised tax fund startup. I was an early customer, and even on their homepage as a testimonial in 2011, Audrey Capital has been an investor since 2013 and if you sign up with this link we both get 5k extra managed for free.\n\n# Aldeas\nTonight was a lot of threads connecting for me. At Automattic’s Noho Space we hosted an event for Martin Scorsese’s new documentary about Pope Francis, called Aldeas. There was a point in my life when I wanted to become a priest, and I had been inspired by meeting a Franciscan seminary student. I took it very seriously and considered that as a path for my life, but some combination of jazz and girls made me realize that the priesthood was not my destiny.\nThe jazz led to building websites for Houston jazz musicians, which led to coding, which led to WordPress, which after a lot of twists and turns led to Automattic acquiring Tumblr. One of Tumblr’s greatest memes was Goncharov, directed by Martin Scorsese. The only reason Automattic, as a distributed company, has an office in NYC is because of the Tumblr acquisition. The office is filled with art from Tumblr artists so I had the very surreal experience of talking after Martin Scorsese, who at 83 is sharp as a tack and a gifted speaker, a few feet away from a Goncharov poster about how my Catholic upbringing led me down the path of starting WordPress, and how Pope Francis’ life inspired the WordPress Jubilee and reflection. Full circle.\nTumblr has a fun 2025 in review, and if you’re a Pocket Casts user open the app to see all your stats for your listening this year.\nA more accurate framing would be that Fizzy is source available. You can read it, run it, and modify it. But DHH’s company is keeping the SaaS rights because they want to be able to build a sustainable business. That is defensible and generous, but it is not open source.\nDries Buytaert follows up on my response to DHH with ‘Source available’ is not open source (and that’s okay).\n\n# DHH & Open Source\nI might have a new prayer: God, give me confidence of DHH claiming his proprietary license is Open Source.\n37signals/Basecamp has a great new product called Fizzy, whose brilliance and innovative qualities are being distracted from by its co-creator David Heinmeier Hansson’s insistence on calling it open source. “One more thing… Fizzy is open source and 100% free to run yourself.”\nThanks to Freedom of Speech, DHH is free to describe his proprietary software as Open Source, a form of greenwashing, and even though he wants to “Well akshually” denigrate those saying why this is BS, we as free citizens are free to explain why, despite how fast he talks and confident he sounds, he’s not always right.\nMyself and other “Actually Open Source” leaders (including DHH) who release software under licenses that meet a common definition of Open Source benefit from decades of prior art and an incredible foundation that lays out the philosophy and definition of what defines open source.\nFor the layperson, though, it might be helpful to break things down in an analogy of authoritarian vs democratic regimes, or a core question of who holds the power.\nProprietary licenses may grant things that feel like freedoms; for example, Fizzy’s O’Saasy license lets you download the source code, run it yourself, modify it, and use a public bug tracker, and you can see the software’s source control history. That’s cool! Also, in the past several years, there have been Middle Eastern countries that have just now allowed women to drive cars. That’s great! However, as a free person choosing to use this software, or choosing to live in a country, you have to ask yourself: Am I still free?\nNo, you’re not. You are allowed to do some things that are in and of themselves good, but ultimately, it’s not built on a foundation of an inalienable right or constitution; it’s at the whim of the leader. O’Saasy license has this restriction:\nNo licensee or downstream recipient may use the Software (including any modified or derivative versions) to directly compete with the original Licensor by offering it to third parties as a hosted, managed, or Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) product or cloud service where the primary value of the service is the functionality of the Software itself.\nOh wow, I can’t compete with the leader. In how they choose to operate their business today, or however they might choose to in the future. My freedoms are at their whim. This violates rule 5 of the OSI definition of Open Source: “The license must not discriminate against any person or group of persons.”\nI’d like to choose software and live in a society that doesn’t discriminate.\nIt’s not uncommon for people trying to take away your freedom to want to use the same words as those in truly free societies. North Korea calls itself the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea. Why? Per Google’s AI:\nSocialist Definition of Democracy During the Cold War, the Soviet Union and its allies used “democracy” to mean “people’s power” through a single ruling party, representing the working class, as opposed to the multi-party “bourgeois” democracy of the West. North Korea adopted this lexicon, as did other communist states like the German Democratic Republic (East Germany).\nYeah, really democratic. In that sense, you can say O’Saasy is an “open” “source” license. Perhaps a bubble of people will agree with you. But the rest of the world will use common sense and see that as a fraud. And most disappointingly for 37signals, a company that prides itself on high integrity, it’s false advertising.\n(For what it’s worth, I tried to resolve this quietly with Jason Fried a few days ago.)\n\n# Happy Birthday Kinsey\nYesterday I had the great honor and privilege of attending a colleague’s 70th birthday party. You may not have heard his name before, but Kinsey Wilson has been at the center of shaping journalism with a movie-worthy career that started at the bottom as a crime reporter in Chicago, and has taken him to the highest echelons at NPR, the New York Times, and, most recently, we’ve been lucky to have him at Automattic.\nKinsey brings a journalistic curiosity and passion for finding truth, paired with a deep optimism and creativity for seeing around the corner for how technology can transform how we consume and produce media.\nWhile his Wikipedia page or biography provides appetizers to some of what he’s done, Kinsey has led such a rich and beautiful life that any attempt to summarize it ends up being criminally reductive. The best you can hope for is to give a taste of his person through vignettes.\nA beautiful snippet from the montage of accolades at his birthday was how Kinsey was someone you’d follow into battle. I’ve learned so much from seeing the empathy, candor, and integrity he brings to every team he leads, which engenders an incredible loyalty I’ve rarely seen in my career. When he left NPR, 62 colleagues made an “Infinite Kinsey” website of accolades.\nThat sort of thing is rare, and it’s been an honor and a privilege to work alongside him to democratize publishing.\nOne of those colleagues, Elise Hu, introduced us while he was at the New York Times and while my intention when I first met him was to get more WordPress at the Times, my imagination was sparked by thinking of how he could bring his experience to help shape WordPress and Automattic, hence my pivot into recruiting him.\nKinsey’s impact on journalism (and podcasting!) at NPR and New York Times is easy to understand, but less well-known is how he came into Automattic and got deep into understanding WordPress and seeing it as a platform that could enable the newsrooms and journalists to accomplish their mission in a more efficient way with the project he leads, Newspack.\nHe’s a fierce steward of the Fourth Estate.\nNewspack and its team’s close relationship to customers invents solutions on top of WordPress that delight its users and percolate and influence everything we do at Automattic. They’re one of the teams that sets the bar for others in the company.\nTo Kinsey, I’ll leave you with a quote from one of my other inspirations, Charlie Munger, who at the tender age of 99 shared a wish with a visitor, “Oh, to be 86 again.”\nI’ll try not to be too tech-bro optimist and say that 70 is the new 40, but I look forward to seeing the ripples that you have on the future of publishing for many years to come.\n\n# Self-driving\nThere has been some lovely writing about self-driving this week, first in the New York Times where Jonathan Slotkin makes the medical case for autonomous vehicles. But I was really taken by The Economist’s look at how self-driving cars will transform urban economies. It’s behind a paywall. I enjoyed how they thought about the second-order effects of self-driving.\nAmerica is home to 1m taxi and bus drivers, as well as over 3m truck drivers—adding up to 3% of the working population. Other potential losers are less obvious. Without car accidents there will, for instance, be less demand for personal-injury lawyers. If people stop buying cars, dealers and used-car salesmen will go.\nIt’s fascinating to think a few chess moves down the line, for example, fewer personal-injury lawyers funding politicians might lead to some form of Tort Reform, an area of society that, like gun control, has centrist changes most Americans would agree with, but has been captured by special interests.\nJames LePage has a great write-up, SOTW 2025:The Year WordPress Became AI-Native.\n\n# Unifi 5G\nOne of my favorite hobbies is home networking and wifi, and once you go down that rabbit hole one of the best companies you can follow is Unifi. They’re such a cool company in so many ways, from having a 4-person board of directors, as a public stock. You can clearly tell they delight in bringing great design to hardware, in a Apple-like attention to detail.\nThey ship such cool products regularly, across an entire ecosystem that spans cameras to access control, it’s hard to describe everything they can cover, and they’ll even have random stuff that integrates into their system like EV charging or digital signage. I get as excited when they ship a new generation of hardware as I do for an iPhone launch.\nBut what’s exciting is that they just launched 5G bridging, with some fun devices that connect everything. I imagine someday I’ll have a Unifi puck hooked up to Starlink, providing amazing routing and connectivity anywhere in the world, powered by some PoE battery.\n\n# State of the Word\nThough the stream didn’t work as we hoped, the recording of this year’s State of the Word, which in many ways was our best one yet, is up now.\n\n# SoTW Eve\nThe State of the Word is tomorrow, and it’s so fun to see SF abuzz with WordPress open source energy. We’re doing a lot of firsts tomorrow, including the first release timed to the State of the Word, and we’ll have a good chunk of the release team there to push the button and bring WordPress 6.9 to the world.\nWe’ll also be crossing streams with another community: in the last ten minutes, we’ll join TBPN, the new must-watch daily tech show.\nThe art and activations are looking so good; it’s fun to see how everything evolves. Tokyo was so beautiful last year; I wasn’t sure how we’d top it, but the creativity of everyone coming together has sparked something new this year that I think is quite cool. We’re trying to honor our mission of democratizing publishing, making things that are powerful and capable, but also retain the flicker of art.\nWe’re also opening up TinkerTendo to the community. I was just there with a few dozen of the crew, and the vibes are so fun. If you’re in SF, definitely swing by and connect with the folks building the most open internet we can all enjoy.\nCheck out the livestream tomorrow, it’ll be a nice capstone to all we’ve built together this year.\nIt’s an interesting cultural moment right now: I think Bryan tweeted, many people are watching people catching balls, while others are watching Bryan Johnson tripping balls. Bryan Johnson, of Blueprint fame, is livestreaming taking a heroic dose of mushrooms. It’s been an interesting journey with the journalist Ashlee Vance, Naval Ravikant, David Friedberg, Marc Benioff, Genevieve Jurvetson, and now a DJ set by Grimes. I was hoping he’d be talking/interacting more with the guests, but it’s been more of a live commentary. Glad all the work Bryan is doing, as Genevieve said, to broaden the Overton window on this, really re-opening a lot of research originially started by the government and pharmacutical companies 50-60 years ago.\nWerner Vogels, CTO at Amazon, boldly publishes his 2026 tech predictions. While you’re on his blog, take a moment to enjoy his essay, Development gets better with Age. Werner and I first crossed paths almost 20 years ago at tech conferences like GigaOm’s Structure, LeWeb, Future of Web Apps, O’Reilly Etech, and TheNextWeb. Though we don’t see each other often, I have enjoyed following his work and writing over the years, and it delights me that he’s still learning and sharing with the same vim and vigor I remember from when we first met. I think he might have been the first person to introduce me to the works of Richard Feynman through a BBC program.\n\n# SF WordPress Party\nWe’ve secured an amazing secret venue for State of the Word on Tuesday, but it has limited capacity in terms of people and has a lot of security hurdles to jump through to get in.\nSo to open things up to the community more, we’re going to activate my hacker/maker art warehouse, TinkerTendo, in the Dogpatch neighbourhood for a simulcast watch party. There will be some cool art from the Misalignment Museum there, great wifi, lots of power plugs and floor seating, a big projection screen and speakers and I think will be a great spot for WordPress folks to hang and network and co-work while in San Francisco. I’ll swing by after the talk to meet everyone as well.\nIf you want access, you can register via Meetup here.\n\n# Thanksgiving\nI want to wish everyone a happy Thanksgiving! To me, the holiday is a reminder to be grateful. A gratitude practice is one of the most surefire ways to improve your happiness, as this study covered by Harvard Health explains.\nI was part of a leadership coaching cohort with other founders and CEOs, and one of our exercises was to have a weekly 15-minute Zoom call where we’d each take turns saying something we were grateful for. (I think the original assignment was 7 minutes, but Parkinson’s law and Google Calendar’s 15-minute default expanded it.) Like most great coaching, it seems silly on the surface, but when you actually practice it with an open mind, something magical happens.\nIt really grew on me, and while most of the randomly assigned pods of people that had this assignment for a few weeks dispersed, ours has kept it going now for several years beyond the conclusion of the coaching program. The calls are also a great way to stay in touch with people I love, but we might easily fall into our own universes and not keep up with each other. Wherever we are in the world, whatever is happening, this standing meeting is on everyone’s calendar, and while it has ebbs and flows, the flame has been kept alive.\nConsider starting your own pod: pick a time, set a standing Zoom room, and see what happens. We do early mornings before most meetings start. I don’t make it every week, but I do more than not, and the weeks when I do are definitely a bit brighter, both in my own gratitude practice and in the connection with the others in the pod.\nWe’re celebrating Thanksgiving this year with my sister Charleen in Austin, and it’s no surprise there’s a great Meshtastic community here!\n\n# 3D Printing Wowza\nIf you have ever customized your home setup, or done extra work to make the cable just so, it’s impossible not to delight in the very deep rabbit holes this person goes in 3D-printing custom holders for everything in his junk drawer. I’m in awe. It’s an ad for Bambu Lab, but honestly it’s the kind of thing I could watch all day. So satisfying. Scott Yu-Jan is someone to keep an eye on.\nTo me, this embodies the maker / hacker / creator mentality that I try to imbue in all the software I work on. How do you make it your own? One of one, but then open source it and see how it gets better.\n\n# Jeff Dean AI Club talk\nThere’s a new video with Jeff Dean talking at the Stanford AI Club, only 2k views so far, he’s half of the pair I blogged the other day.\n\n# Posts navigation\n - Home\n - About\n - Contact\n - Distributed\n - X\n - Telegram\n - Let’s Work Together",
