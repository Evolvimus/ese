I love the option to save lists, but unfortunately it doesn’t work. Several times now I have made separate saved items lists only to find they’re completely gone when I return. How is it possible that the company that pioneered the use of the cloud doesn’t use the cloud to remember their customer’s saved items in their own app? Baffling. Other than that I love to see which third party products are featured in the app before I make my final decisions as in my opinion, having something that is endorsed by Apple gives me a little bit more peace of mind when making expensive tech purchases. The tab where you can explore what’s happening at the Apple stores near me, etc. is also a fantastic one, so I can learn more in depth info about my products.

Fixed reviews by staff and developers.         Sep 19   hotace6813    I had auto download and update off, the new update forced mine and my wife’s phone to update after 3 days me telling it no. I smell a class action lawsuit. Forcing us to lock in with a cell phone carrier for 2-3 years per phone. We have a family business and have multiple phones, we are all having issues. I googled the same issues are wide spread. Every “new” update makes it worst. ThisLatest changes my settings and icons. It freezes all day long. I can’t uninstall the update. Even a set up new phone don’t help because it forces the latest “flawed” and zero day vulnerabilities in these apps. I’ve been a victim of identity theft 3 times already since I got these phones. Don’t tell me iPhones can’t get hacked. Give us the owners of the phone the option to not install or uninstall your useless  “security” fixes. Every time you force us to update all that screws up our phone, which then forces us to buy a new phone just to turn around for you  to screw it up. It’s a never ending scam. You’re useless. These phones ain’t worth the paperweight used for. You should be ashamed of yourself Apple should be shut down permanently. Goodbye.       Useless app and developers.

I bought my bsf a iMac computer, and she used my card. But not thinking, to even put all my info in far as billing address. She ended up putting hers and Apple took my money, but then said they didn’t because it was pending. And I’m like how because it say it took it. But anyways when someone is doing something like that on the website, it needs to be an immediate email saying wrong billing address. So we don’t be no problems. Like I understand theft is out there and people scam A LOT, but it needs to be some type of alert that says “Not matching billing address”…even though the error was on our side because we wasn’t thinking in that moment because it’s common sense. But maybe that can be changed in the future.       Needs an update          Nov 1   Nynini91  I love Apple and everything, but there needs to be a slight update when buying something.
