Participation in the Program is subject to these terms and conditions for Renewable Membership and the general U.S. Terms of Use, Privacy Policy, Uber's Community Guidelines, which are incorporated herein (collectively, the \"Renewable Membership Terms\"). Uber is a technology company which provides mobile applications for users to arrange and schedule transportation and/or delivery services with third party providers of such services under agreement with Uber or certain of Uber's affiliates. Uber is not a provider of transportation or delivery services, as such all benefits and discounts offered under the Program are offered on an \"as available\" basis, contingent upon third-parties' availability to provide the transportation or delivery services and other contingencies which may impact availability of some benefits at certain times and places. Renewable Memberships are provided in connection with use of the rider app, and/or the Uber Eats and Postmates app (“Uber Apps”).\n\n# 1. How Renewable Memberships Work\nYou may receive an offer in-app or by email for specific renewable benefits and discounts that can be applied on Uber App purchases (“Offer”). Each Offer will include important details and terms, such as where and when a Renewable Membership may be used, the benefit(s) conferred by the Renewable Membership (“Membership Benefits”), the cost of the Renewable Membership (“Membership Rate”), and the billing interval (“Billing Cycle”). Please refer to your Offer for details before purchasing the Renewable Membership. When you buy a Renewable Membership you agree to have your default payment method charged every Billing Cycle on a recurring basis , you agree to these Renewable Membership Terms, as well as the specific terms of the Offer. You also agree that Uber may contact you at any time through any channel regarding issues with your membership. Offers are limited and subject to change. By participating in this Program you are agreeing to these Renewable Membership Terms. If you do not agree to these Renewable Membership Terms, do not participate in the Program.\n\n# 2. Duration and Frequency of Charges\nWhen you buy a Renewable Membership, you'll be charged the Membership Rate for your first Billing Cycle on the date of purchase, which activates the Renewable Membership for the term set forth in your Offer. Unless you notify us in accordance with Section 3 (Canceling your Renewable Membership) that you want to cancel, you understand that your Renewable Membership will continue and your selected payment method (“Default Payment Method”) will automatically be charged no more than 24 hours before the renewal day stated in your membership hub in the Uber App. Renewal day is the day that your membership and associated benefits automatically renew. UNLESS YOU CANCEL YOUR RENEWABLE MEMBERSHIP, IT WILL AUTOMATICALLY RENEW AT THE BEGINNING OF EACH BILLING CYCLE, AND YOU AUTHORIZE US TO COLLECT THE APPLICABLE MEMBERSHIP RATE (WITHOUT PRIOR NOTICE UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW), USING YOUR DEFAULT PAYMENT METHOD OR ANY OTHER ELIGIBLE PAYMENT METHOD SAVED IN YOUR WALLET. You may add multiple payment methods to your wallet, and you agree when you add a payment method to your wallet, Uber may store and charge that payment method for the collection of your Membership Rate or any other services you may purchase from Uber. If your Default Payment Method is declined for any reason (such as expiration or insufficient funds), you authorize Uber to charge another payment method in your wallet. If no other payment method is saved in your Uber wallet, Uber may prompt you for a new payment method. If all eligible payment methods in your wallet are declined , you must provide us with a new eligible payment method or your Renewable Membership may be canceled or paused as further described in Section 4. If declined, Uber may also retry to charge your Default Payment Method or any other payment method in your wallet over the course of your billing cycle to help you get back to enjoying the benefits of your membership. You agree that Uber may contact you at any time and through any channel regarding a failed payment.\nIf you select Uber Cash to be used for payment and there is insufficient Uber Cash to complete your Renewable Membership payment for any Billing Cycle, an additional payment method stored in your wallet will be charged the remaining balance.\nUber reserves the right to pause and/or terminate your Renewable Membership with no further charges to you if Uber is unable to collect payment from you. Uber and/or its parent, subsidiaries and/or affiliates are not responsible for any fees charged by your bank including, but not limited to, overdraft fees, insufficient funds fees, interest charges, foreign exchange fees, cross border fees, and other penalties.\nIf we are unable to refund a transaction on your original payment method (e.g., due to cancellation or expiration of payment method), Uber will refund you in Uber Cash.\n\n# 3. Canceling Your Renewable Membership\nYou may cancel your Renewable Membership within the applicable Uber App at any time. To do this, go to the applicable Renewable Membership section (e.g., Uber One) in the Uber App that you purchased your Renewable Membership in and select “Manage Membership.” Select the option for “End membership,” and then confirm you wish to cancel your subscription. If you cancel within 24 hours prior to your renewal day and your payment for the next Billing Cycle already has been processed, Uber will issue an automatic refund for that payment. The timing of the refund depends on your payment method provider.\nIf you cancel your Renewable Membership, you will still have access to your Membership Benefits until the end of the current Billing Cycle; however, if you have a free trial and you cancel your Renewable Membership, then your access to your Membership Benefits will end immediately upon cancellation. If you acquired your free trial through a third-party promotional offer, you will retain access to your Membership Benefits for the duration of the promotional offer, after which your Membership Benefits will end. Additionally, any previously earned Uber One Credits that were earned pursuant to section 7 below cannot be used without an active membership. All payments for a monthly Renewal Membership already charged for the current Billing Cycle are non-refundable and non-transferable, and will not be refunded on a pro-rata basis for any cancellation initiated during a Billing Cycle. Please use help.uber.com to report any unauthorized charges within 60 days. Uber is not responsible for overdraft fees that may be incurred.\n\n# 4. Pausing your Renewable Membership\nOccasionally, you may want to pause your membership.\nYou may pause your Renewable Membership for a specific time period (“Paused State”) if you have a monthly membership and are not on a free trial or a partner-sponsored offer at the time of the pause. When you pause your subscription, your Paused State will begin once your current Billing Cycle ends. Once your Paused State expires, you will be charged the Membership Rate and your Renewable Membership will automatically renew for the next Billing Cycle. You must pause at least 24 hours before your billing day to avoid being charged for the next Billing Cycle.\nYou can pause your Renewable Membership up to four (4) times per calendar year. During the Paused State, you will not be charged the Membership Rate and the Membership Benefits will not apply. You also will not receive any member-specific promotions. You may resume your membership at any time.\n\n# 5. Promotions & Offers\n## Combining Promotions\nNotwithstanding the terms and conditions of other promotions offered by Uber or third parties, Uber in its sole discretion may permit Membership Benefits to be combined with other offers and promotions.\n## Geographic Scope of Promotions\nMembership Benefits are limited to the country in which you purchase your Renewable Membership (your “Membership Country”). If you travel outside of your Membership Country, your Membership Benefits may not apply to any Uber App purchases made while outside of your Membership Country.\n## Queued Offers\nIf you’re currently using an offer that applies to your Uber One membership fee, your next queued offer (if available) will start when your current offer ends, as long as your membership has not been terminated or canceled. For offers tied to your payment card, that card must still be valid and on your account when the related offer starts. For offers tied to your employer, you must still be employed by that employer at the time the offer starts. Subject to your rights under consumer laws, your recurring payment will not be refundable. See app for available offers, details, fees, and terms.\n\n# 6. Free Trial and Third-Party Partnerships\nUber and/or third parties authorized by Uber (“Authorized Partner”) may offer some users a free trial or other promotional subscriptions to a Renewable Membership. Such trial or promotional subscriptions are subject to these Renewable Membership Terms except as otherwise stated in your Offer. Only one trial or promotional subscription is available per user. Free trial or promotional subscriptions eligibility is determined by Uber at its sole discretion and Uber may limit such eligibility or duration to prevent free trial abuse. Certain limitations may exist with respect to combining a free trial with any other offers.\nFor some trials or promotional subscriptions, we require you to provide your payment details to start the trial or promotional subscription. BY PROVIDING SUCH DETAILS YOU AGREE THAT AT THE END OF YOUR APPLICABLE FREE TRIAL OR PROMOTIONAL SUBSCRIPTION PERIOD, YOUR RENEWABLE MEMBERSHIP WILL AUTOMATICALLY RENEW AND YOU WILL BE CHARGED THE MEMBERSHIP RATE STATED IN YOUR OFFER NO MORE THAN 24 HOURS PRIOR TO THE BEGINNING OF EACH BILLING CYCLE UNTIL YOU CANCEL YOUR RENEWABLE MEMBERSHIP. IF YOU DO NOT WANT THIS CHARGE, YOU MUST CANCEL THE APPLICABLE TRIAL OR PROMOTIONAL SUBSCRIPTION BEFORE THE END OF THE TRIAL OR PROMOTIONAL SUBSCRIPTION IN ACCORDANCE WITH SECTION 3 ABOVE.\nPromotional subscriptions for Renewable Memberships that are offered or provided by Authorized Partners may be subject to additional terms and conditions, which will be presented at the time of the offer by the Authorized Partner. Depending on the terms of your promotion or offer, the Authorized Partner may manage aspects of your membership, including but not limited to, payments and cancellation. Check with the Authorized Partner for additional information.\n\n# 7. Uber One credits Membership Benefit\nOne benefit of your Renewable Membership is that you will receive promotional credits in your Uber Wallet based on a percentage of what you spend on eligible rides (i.e. Uber One credits). Uber One credits provided as a benefit in connection with your Renewable Membership account, shall expire consistent with any applicable expiration date upon receipt of the Uber One credits and as shown in the Uber One membership section of your app. The expiration dates shall be determined at Uber's sole discretion. Any Uber One credits earned in connection with your Renewable Membership shall be calculated as a percentage of the final fare as it appears in your itemized receipt (and not on any upfront fare/price) and earned exclusive of any taxes, tolls, surcharges, any other fees (as determined by Uber in its sole discretion). In addition, when Uber One credits are used, in whole or part, as payment for an eligible ride or Eats order, Uber One credits will not be earned on the portion that is covered by Uber One credits. Uber One Credit earned on a particular trip cannot be used as payment on the same trip.\nUpon termination or cancellation of your Renewable Membership your Uber One credits shall expire at the end of that membership cycle. For further details, please see our terms and conditions related to Uber One credits.\n\n# 8. Free or Discounted Trials\nUber and/or third parties on behalf of Uber may offer some users a free or discounted trial or other promotional offers for a Renewable Membership. Such trial or promotional subscriptions are subject to these Renewable Membership Terms except as otherwise stated in your Offer. Only one trial or promotional subscription is available per user. Free or discounted trial eligibility is determined by Uber at its sole discretion and Uber may limit such eligibility or duration to prevent free or discounted trial abuse. Certain limitations may exist with respect to combining a free trial with any other offers.\nFor some trials or promotional offers for a Renewable Membership, we require you to provide your payment details to start the trial or promotion. BY PROVIDING SUCH DETAILS YOU AGREE THAT AT THE END OF YOUR APPLICABLE FREE OR DISCOUNTED TRIAL OR PROMOTIONAL SUBSCRIPTION PERIOD, YOUR RENEWABLE MEMBERSHIP WILL AUTOMATICALLY RENEW AND YOU WILL BE CHARGED THE MEMBERSHIP RATE STATED IN YOUR OFFER NO MORE THAN 24 HOURS PRIOR TO THE BEGINNING OF EACH BILLING CYCLE UNTIL YOU CANCEL YOUR RENEWABLE MEMBERSHIP. IF YOU DO NOT WANT THIS CHARGE, YOU MUST CANCEL THE APPLICABLE TRIAL OR PROMOTIONAL SUBSCRIPTION BEFORE THE END OF THE TRIAL OR PROMOTIONAL SUBSCRIPTION IN ACCORDANCE WITH SECTION 3 ABOVE. If you do not provide a payment method at the time you sign up for the trial or promotional offer, you agree that we may automatically charge your Default Payment Method.\n\n# 9. Uber One for Students\nIn Uber’s sole discretion, Uber may offer a category of the Renewable Membership to students (“Uber One Student” or “Uber One for Students”). Uber One Student subscriptions may be offered at a discounted price on either a monthly or annual basis to qualifying students who are currently enrolled at an accredited college or university. Potential Uber One Student members must pass the verification requirements and may be required to provide documentation so that Uber may verify their eligibility for the plan. Uber contracts with a third party, SheerID, for verification services. Please see SheerID’s Terms of Services for additional information. Uber One Student members must reverify their eligibility annually. If an Uber One Student member fails reverification, they will be converted to a full priced annual or monthly plan, depending on the type of Uber One Student in which they were previously enrolled (e.g., if you had an Uber One for Students monthly plan, you will revert to standard monthly plan) . Without notice and in its sole discretion, Uber may add to, or replace, such third party verifier, so long as such replacement does not materially alter the verification process.\nUber One Student members may be offered other distinct discounts or promotional offers in Uber’s sole discretion. Similarly, Uber One Student members may be excluded from certain promotional offers, including those offered by third-party partners. Uber One for Students is subject to the Renewable Membership Terms as applicable.\n\n# 10. Benefits for Teens\nIn Uber’s sole discretion, Uber may allow guardians with Uber One Memberships to have their benefits extended to Teens linked to their accounts. The extension of benefits to teens is subject to the Teen Account Terms of Use. The Teen will receive the same benefits as the guardian on restaurant and rides orders, including Uber One credits back on trips, which can be used by the Teen to purchase future rides or delivery orders. Teens will not have the ability to manage their guardian’s membership in any way, including but not limited to updating payment methods, updating the Membership plan type, or canceling the plan. Teens utilizing their guardian’s benefits will remain subject to these Membership Terms as applicable.\nTeens are under no circumstance allowed to have their own Uber One membership, and may only access benefits they receive through their guardian with a Membership. Without notice and in its sole discretion, Uber may exclude teens from certain promotional offers, including those offered by third-party partners.\n\n# 11. Linked Accounts: Family sharing\nFamily sharing is available to eligible Primary Members with a paid monthly or annual Renewable Membership and may not be available in all locations. The following plan types are ineligible: Preview, Student Plan, free or extended trials, partner offers, and Uber for Business or U4G memberships. A Primary Member is the paying account holder, and a Secondary Member is an adult invited under Family sharing. Both accounts must be in the same Membership Country or market.\nLinked Accounts may receive core membership benefits shared by the Primary Member, such as Uber One credits, $0 Delivery Fee where offered, reduced service fees or basket discounts, and priority matching with top-rated drivers and couriers when available. Partner perks, third-party benefits, limited-time or promotional offers, and certain merchant promotions are only available to the Primary Member, unless Uber states otherwise. Uber may, at its discretion, exclude Linked Accounts from promotional offers or product experiments, and benefit eligibility may differ or change at any time.\nA Primary Member may link one (1) Secondary Member at a time and may change the selected Secondary Member no more than once per calendar year. Secondary Members lose access to Uber One benefits immediately upon being removed by the Primary Member. Uber may, but is not required to, reset this annual limit if the Primary Member’s Renewable Membership lapses and is later reactivated. Access to shared benefits follows the Primary Member’s status. If the Primary Member’s membership is paused, canceled, suspended, or terminated, Linked Accounts lose access at the same time without separate notice or refund. Family sharing is intended for members of the same household, and Uber may remove or restrict access if misuse, fraud, or ineligibility is detected as determined by Uber in its sole discretion.\nBy linking accounts, the Primary Member authorizes Uber to process and share limited information needed to administer Family sharing, in line with Uber’s Privacy Policy. Uber may send service or transactional messages to both the Primary and Secondary Members about shared benefits.\n\n# 12. Changes to Renewable Memberships\nUber reserves the right to modify or stop offering Renewable Memberships or change Membership Rates, Membership Benefits, or route prices, at any time in its sole discretion. In the event Uber increases the Membership Rate of a Renewable Membership, we will provide you with thirty (30) days prior notice via email before such changes take effect. All changes will be effective upon your next Billing Cycle, but if you do not agree with the price change, you have the right to reject the new Membership Rate and may avoid these charges by canceling your Renewable Membership according to the instructions in Section 3 above.\nUber may terminate your Renewable Membership at our discretion without notice. If that happens, Uber will give you a pro-rated refund based on charges already applied to your current billing period. We will not give any refund for termination related to conduct that we determine, in our sole discretion, violates these Renewable Membership Terms, any applicable law, or involves fraud or misuse of the Renewable Membership.\n\n# 13. Changes to Renewable Membership Terms\nUber reserves the right to modify these Renewable Membership Terms. If we make material changes to the Renewable Membership Terms while you have an active Renewable Membership, we will notify you either in the Renewable Membership section of the applicable Uber App and/or via email. Your continued use of a Renewable Membership constitutes your acceptance of the revised Renewable Membership Terms. If you are not willing to agree to the revisions, you may cancel your Renewable Membership in accordance with Section 3 above.\n\n# 14. Transfer of Rights\nUber's rights and obligations under the Program may be assigned or transferred by Uber to any other related or unrelated entity at any time, and performances shall be the responsibility of that entity.\n\n# 15. Interpretation of Renewable Membership Terms\nAll interpretations of these Renewable Membership Terms will be at Uber's sole discretion and Uber's decisions will be final.\n\n# 16. Disclaimer\nThe Program and/or any of its features may be unavailable, inaccurate or interrupted from time to time for a variety of reasons. We are not responsible for any unavailability, interruptions or errors of the Program or its features. Uber may from time to time request information from you to confirm your identity before renewing your Renewable Membership. Uber may delay your access to your Renewable Membership until you comply with this information request. The Program and all the information accessible through it are provided for information purposes only on an \"as is\" and \"as available\" basis. We, our information providers and their agents make no warranties, representations, or guarantees of any kind, express or implied, including but not limited to, accuracy, currency, or completeness, the operation of the Program, the information, materials, content, availability, and products.

Participation in the Program is subject to these terms and conditions for Renewable Membership and the general U.S. Terms of Use, Privacy Policy, Uber's Community Guidelines, which are incorporated herein (collectively, the \"Renewable Membership Terms\"). Uber is a technology company which provides mobile applications for users to arrange and schedule transportation and/or delivery services with third party providers of such services under agreement with Uber or certain of Uber's affiliates. Uber is not a provider of transportation or delivery services, as such all benefits and discounts offered under the Program are offered on an \"as available\" basis, contingent upon third-parties' availability to provide the transportation or delivery services and other contingencies which may impact availability of some benefits at certain times and places. Renewable Memberships are provided in connection with use of the rider app, and/or the Uber Eats and Postmates app (“Uber Apps”).\n\n# 1. How Renewable Memberships Work\nYou may receive an offer in-app or by email for specific renewable benefits and discounts that can be applied on Uber App purchases (“Offer”). Each Offer will include important details and terms, such as where and when a Renewable Membership may be used, the benefit(s) conferred by the Renewable Membership (“Membership Benefits”), the cost of the Renewable Membership (“Membership Rate”), and the billing interval (“Billing Cycle”). Please refer to your Offer for details before purchasing the Renewable Membership. When you buy a Renewable Membership you agree to have your default payment method charged every Billing Cycle on a recurring basis , you agree to these Renewable Membership Terms, as well as the specific terms of the Offer. You also agree that Uber may contact you at any time through any channel regarding issues with your membership. Offers are limited and subject to change. By participating in this Program you are agreeing to these Renewable Membership Terms. If you do not agree to these Renewable Membership Terms, do not participate in the Program.\n\n# 2. Duration and Frequency of Charges\nWhen you buy a Renewable Membership, you'll be charged the Membership Rate for your first Billing Cycle on the date of purchase, which activates the Renewable Membership for the term set forth in your Offer. Unless you notify us in accordance with Section 3 (Canceling your Renewable Membership) that you want to cancel, you understand that your Renewable Membership will continue and your selected payment method (“Default Payment Method”) will automatically be charged no more than 24 hours before the renewal day stated in your membership hub in the Uber App. Renewal day is the day that your membership and associated benefits automatically renew. UNLESS YOU CANCEL YOUR RENEWABLE MEMBERSHIP, IT WILL AUTOMATICALLY RENEW AT THE BEGINNING OF EACH BILLING CYCLE, AND YOU AUTHORIZE US TO COLLECT THE APPLICABLE MEMBERSHIP RATE (WITHOUT PRIOR NOTICE UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW), USING YOUR DEFAULT PAYMENT METHOD OR ANY OTHER ELIGIBLE PAYMENT METHOD SAVED IN YOUR WALLET. You may add multiple payment methods to your wallet, and you agree when you add a payment method to your wallet, Uber may store and charge that payment method for the collection of your Membership Rate or any other services you may purchase from Uber. If your Default Payment Method is declined for any reason (such as expiration or insufficient funds), you authorize Uber to charge another payment method in your wallet. If no other payment method is saved in your Uber wallet, Uber may prompt you for a new payment method. If all eligible payment methods in your wallet are declined , you must provide us with a new eligible payment method or your Renewable Membership may be canceled or paused as further described in Section 4. If declined, Uber may also retry to charge your Default Payment Method or any other payment method in your wallet over the course of your billing cycle to help you get back to enjoying the benefits of your membership. You agree that Uber may contact you at any time and through any channel regarding a failed payment.\nIf you select Uber Cash to be used for payment and there is insufficient Uber Cash to complete your Renewable Membership payment for any Billing Cycle, an additional payment method stored in your wallet will be charged the remaining balance.\nUber reserves the right to pause and/or terminate your Renewable Membership with no further charges to you if Uber is unable to collect payment from you. Uber and/or its parent, subsidiaries and/or affiliates are not responsible for any fees charged by your bank including, but not limited to, overdraft fees, insufficient funds fees, interest charges, foreign exchange fees, cross border fees, and other penalties.\nIf we are unable to refund a transaction on your original payment method (e.g., due to cancellation or expiration of payment method), Uber will refund you in Uber Cash.\n\n# 3. Canceling Your Renewable Membership\nYou may cancel your Renewable Membership within the applicable Uber App at any time. To do this, go to the applicable Renewable Membership section (e.g., Uber One) in the Uber App that you purchased your Renewable Membership in and select “Manage Membership.” Select the option for “End membership,” and then confirm you wish to cancel your subscription. If you cancel within 24 hours prior to your renewal day and your payment for the next Billing Cycle already has been processed, Uber will issue an automatic refund for that payment. The timing of the refund depends on your payment method provider.\nIf you cancel your Renewable Membership, you will still have access to your Membership Benefits until the end of the current Billing Cycle; however, if you have a free trial and you cancel your Renewable Membership, then your access to your Membership Benefits will end immediately upon cancellation. If you acquired your free trial through a third-party promotional offer, you will retain access to your Membership Benefits for the duration of the promotional offer, after which your Membership Benefits will end. Additionally, any previously earned Uber One Credits that were earned pursuant to section 7 below cannot be used without an active membership. All payments for a monthly Renewal Membership already charged for the current Billing Cycle are non-refundable and non-transferable, and will not be refunded on a pro-rata basis for any cancellation initiated during a Billing Cycle. Please use help.uber.com to report any unauthorized charges within 60 days. Uber is not responsible for overdraft fees that may be incurred.\n\n# 4. Pausing your Renewable Membership\nOccasionally, you may want to pause your membership.\nYou may pause your Renewable Membership for a specific time period (“Paused State”) if you have a monthly membership and are not on a free trial or a partner-sponsored offer at the time of the pause. When you pause your subscription, your Paused State will begin once your current Billing Cycle ends. Once your Paused State expires, you will be charged the Membership Rate and your Renewable Membership will automatically renew for the next Billing Cycle. You must pause at least 24 hours before your billing day to avoid being charged for the next Billing Cycle.\nYou can pause your Renewable Membership up to four (4) times per calendar year. During the Paused State, you will not be charged the Membership Rate and the Membership Benefits will not apply. You also will not receive any member-specific promotions. You may resume your membership at any time.\n\n# 5. Promotions & Offers\n## Combining Promotions\nNotwithstanding the terms and conditions of other promotions offered by Uber or third parties, Uber in its sole discretion may permit Membership Benefits to be combined with other offers and promotions.\n## Geographic Scope of Promotions\nMembership Benefits are limited to the country in which you purchase your Renewable Membership (your “Membership Country”). If you travel outside of your Membership Country, your Membership Benefits may not apply to any Uber App purchases made while outside of your Membership Country.\n## Queued Offers\nIf you’re currently using an offer that applies to your Uber One membership fee, your next queued offer (if available) will start when your current offer ends, as long as your membership has not been terminated or canceled. For offers tied to your payment card, that card must still be valid and on your account when the related offer starts. For offers tied to your employer, you must still be employed by that employer at the time the offer starts. Subject to your rights under consumer laws, your recurring payment will not be refundable. See app for available offers, details, fees, and terms.\n\n# 6. Free Trial and Third-Party Partnerships\nUber and/or third parties authorized by Uber (“Authorized Partner”) may offer some users a free trial or other promotional subscriptions to a Renewable Membership. Such trial or promotional subscriptions are subject to these Renewable Membership Terms except as otherwise stated in your Offer. Only one trial or promotional subscription is available per user. Free trial or promotional subscriptions eligibility is determined by Uber at its sole discretion and Uber may limit such eligibility or duration to prevent free trial abuse. Certain limitations may exist with respect to combining a free trial with any other offers.\nFor some trials or promotional subscriptions, we require you to provide your payment details to start the trial or promotional subscription. BY PROVIDING SUCH DETAILS YOU AGREE THAT AT THE END OF YOUR APPLICABLE FREE TRIAL OR PROMOTIONAL SUBSCRIPTION PERIOD, YOUR RENEWABLE MEMBERSHIP WILL AUTOMATICALLY RENEW AND YOU WILL BE CHARGED THE MEMBERSHIP RATE STATED IN YOUR OFFER NO MORE THAN 24 HOURS PRIOR TO THE BEGINNING OF EACH BILLING CYCLE UNTIL YOU CANCEL YOUR RENEWABLE MEMBERSHIP. IF YOU DO NOT WANT THIS CHARGE, YOU MUST CANCEL THE APPLICABLE TRIAL OR PROMOTIONAL SUBSCRIPTION BEFORE THE END OF THE TRIAL OR PROMOTIONAL SUBSCRIPTION IN ACCORDANCE WITH SECTION 3 ABOVE.\nPromotional subscriptions for Renewable Memberships that are offered or provided by Authorized Partners may be subject to additional terms and conditions, which will be presented at the time of the offer by the Authorized Partner. Depending on the terms of your promotion or offer, the Authorized Partner may manage aspects of your membership, including but not limited to, payments and cancellation. Check with the Authorized Partner for additional information.\n\n# 7. Uber One credits Membership Benefit\nOne benefit of your Renewable Membership is that you will receive promotional credits in your Uber Wallet based on a percentage of what you spend on eligible rides (i.e. Uber One credits). Uber One credits provided as a benefit in connection with your Renewable Membership account, shall expire consistent with any applicable expiration date upon receipt of the Uber One credits and as shown in the Uber One membership section of your app. The expiration dates shall be determined at Uber's sole discretion. Any Uber One credits earned in connection with your Renewable Membership shall be calculated as a percentage of the final fare as it appears in your itemized receipt (and not on any upfront fare/price) and earned exclusive of any taxes, tolls, surcharges, any other fees (as determined by Uber in its sole discretion). In addition, when Uber One credits are used, in whole or part, as payment for an eligible ride or Eats order, Uber One credits will not be earned on the portion that is covered by Uber One credits. Uber One Credit earned on a particular trip cannot be used as payment on the same trip.\nUpon termination or cancellation of your Renewable Membership your Uber One credits shall expire at the end of that membership cycle. For further details, please see our terms and conditions related to Uber One credits.\n\n# 8. Free or Discounted Trials\nUber and/or third parties on behalf of Uber may offer some users a free or discounted trial or other promotional offers for a Renewable Membership. Such trial or promotional subscriptions are subject to these Renewable Membership Terms except as otherwise stated in your Offer. Only one trial or promotional subscription is available per user. Free or discounted trial eligibility is determined by Uber at its sole discretion and Uber may limit such eligibility or duration to prevent free or discounted trial abuse. Certain limitations may exist with respect to combining a free trial with any other offers.\nFor some trials or promotional offers for a Renewable Membership, we require you to provide your payment details to start the trial or promotion. BY PROVIDING SUCH DETAILS YOU AGREE THAT AT THE END OF YOUR APPLICABLE FREE OR DISCOUNTED TRIAL OR PROMOTIONAL SUBSCRIPTION PERIOD, YOUR RENEWABLE MEMBERSHIP WILL AUTOMATICALLY RENEW AND YOU WILL BE CHARGED THE MEMBERSHIP RATE STATED IN YOUR OFFER NO MORE THAN 24 HOURS PRIOR TO THE BEGINNING OF EACH BILLING CYCLE UNTIL YOU CANCEL YOUR RENEWABLE MEMBERSHIP. IF YOU DO NOT WANT THIS CHARGE, YOU MUST CANCEL THE APPLICABLE TRIAL OR PROMOTIONAL SUBSCRIPTION BEFORE THE END OF THE TRIAL OR PROMOTIONAL SUBSCRIPTION IN ACCORDANCE WITH SECTION 3 ABOVE. If you do not provide a payment method at the time you sign up for the trial or promotional offer, you agree that we may automatically charge your Default Payment Method.\n\n# 9. Uber One for Students\nIn Uber’s sole discretion, Uber may offer a category of the Renewable Membership to students (“Uber One Student” or “Uber One for Students”). Uber One Student subscriptions may be offered at a discounted price on either a monthly or annual basis to qualifying students who are currently enrolled at an accredited college or university. Potential Uber One Student members must pass the verification requirements and may be required to provide documentation so that Uber may verify their eligibility for the plan. Uber contracts with a third party, SheerID, for verification services. Please see SheerID’s Terms of Services for additional information. Uber One Student members must reverify their eligibility annually. If an Uber One Student member fails reverification, they will be converted to a full priced annual or monthly plan, depending on the type of Uber One Student in which they were previously enrolled (e.g., if you had an Uber One for Students monthly plan, you will revert to standard monthly plan) . Without notice and in its sole discretion, Uber may add to, or replace, such third party verifier, so long as such replacement does not materially alter the verification process.\nUber One Student members may be offered other distinct discounts or promotional offers in Uber’s sole discretion. Similarly, Uber One Student members may be excluded from certain promotional offers, including those offered by third-party partners. Uber One for Students is subject to the Renewable Membership Terms as applicable.\n\n# 10. Benefits for Teens\nIn Uber’s sole discretion, Uber may allow guardians with Uber One Memberships to have their benefits extended to Teens linked to their accounts. The extension of benefits to teens is subject to the Teen Account Terms of Use. The Teen will receive the same benefits as the guardian on restaurant and rides orders, including Uber One credits back on trips, which can be used by the Teen to purchase future rides or delivery orders. Teens will not have the ability to manage their guardian’s membership in any way, including but not limited to updating payment methods, updating the Membership plan type, or canceling the plan. Teens utilizing their guardian’s benefits will remain subject to these Membership Terms as applicable.\nTeens are under no circumstance allowed to have their own Uber One membership, and may only access benefits they receive through their guardian with a Membership. Without notice and in its sole discretion, Uber may exclude teens from certain promotional offers, including those offered by third-party partners.\n\n# 11. Linked Accounts: Family sharing\nFamily sharing is available to eligible Primary Members with a paid monthly or annual Renewable Membership and may not be available in all locations. The following plan types are ineligible: Preview, Student Plan, free or extended trials, partner offers, and Uber for Business or U4G memberships. A Primary Member is the paying account holder, and a Secondary Member is an adult invited under Family sharing. Both accounts must be in the same Membership Country or market.\nLinked Accounts may receive core membership benefits shared by the Primary Member, such as Uber One credits, $0 Delivery Fee where offered, reduced service fees or basket discounts, and priority matching with top-rated drivers and couriers when available. Partner perks, third-party benefits, limited-time or promotional offers, and certain merchant promotions are only available to the Primary Member, unless Uber states otherwise. Uber may, at its discretion, exclude Linked Accounts from promotional offers or product experiments, and benefit eligibility may differ or change at any time.\nA Primary Member may link one (1) Secondary Member at a time and may change the selected Secondary Member no more than once per calendar year. Secondary Members lose access to Uber One benefits immediately upon being removed by the Primary Member. Uber may, but is not required to, reset this annual limit if the Primary Member’s Renewable Membership lapses and is later reactivated. Access to shared benefits follows the Primary Member’s status. If the Primary Member’s membership is paused, canceled, suspended, or terminated, Linked Accounts lose access at the same time without separate notice or refund. Family sharing is intended for members of the same household, and Uber may remove or restrict access if misuse, fraud, or ineligibility is detected as determined by Uber in its sole discretion.\nBy linking accounts, the Primary Member authorizes Uber to process and share limited information needed to administer Family sharing, in line with Uber’s Privacy Policy. Uber may send service or transactional messages to both the Primary and Secondary Members about shared benefits.\n\n# 12. Changes to Renewable Memberships\nUber reserves the right to modify or stop offering Renewable Memberships or change Membership Rates, Membership Benefits, or route prices, at any time in its sole discretion. In the event Uber increases the Membership Rate of a Renewable Membership, we will provide you with thirty (30) days prior notice via email before such changes take effect. All changes will be effective upon your next Billing Cycle, but if you do not agree with the price change, you have the right to reject the new Membership Rate and may avoid these charges by canceling your Renewable Membership according to the instructions in Section 3 above.\nUber may terminate your Renewable Membership at our discretion without notice. If that happens, Uber will give you a pro-rated refund based on charges already applied to your current billing period. We will not give any refund for termination related to conduct that we determine, in our sole discretion, violates these Renewable Membership Terms, any applicable law, or involves fraud or misuse of the Renewable Membership.\n\n# 13. Changes to Renewable Membership Terms\nUber reserves the right to modify these Renewable Membership Terms. If we make material changes to the Renewable Membership Terms while you have an active Renewable Membership, we will notify you either in the Renewable Membership section of the applicable Uber App and/or via email. Your continued use of a Renewable Membership constitutes your acceptance of the revised Renewable Membership Terms. If you are not willing to agree to the revisions, you may cancel your Renewable Membership in accordance with Section 3 above.\n\n# 14. Transfer of Rights\nUber's rights and obligations under the Program may be assigned or transferred by Uber to any other related or unrelated entity at any time, and performances shall be the responsibility of that entity.\n\n# 15. Interpretation of Renewable Membership Terms\nAll interpretations of these Renewable Membership Terms will be at Uber's sole discretion and Uber's decisions will be final.\n\n# 16. Disclaimer\nThe Program and/or any of its features may be unavailable, inaccurate or interrupted from time to time for a variety of reasons. We are not responsible for any unavailability, interruptions or errors of the Program or its features. Uber may from time to time request information from you to confirm your identity before renewing your Renewable Membership. Uber may delay your access to your Renewable Membership until you comply with this information request. The Program and all the information accessible through it are provided for information purposes only on an \"as is\" and \"as available\" basis. We, our information providers and their agents make no warranties, representations, or guarantees of any kind, express or implied, including but not limited to, accuracy, currency, or completeness, the operation of the Program, the information, materials, content, availability, and products. Renewable Memberships and these Renewable Membership Terms are provided by Uber and do not modify the contractual relationships among or between the individuals and entities that use Uber’s technology to offer goods or services, and Uber or any Uber affiliates (including without limitation Rasier, LLC and Portier, LLC), except as expressly set forth herein. To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, we disclaim all warranties, express or implied, including but not limited to, implied warranties of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose.\n\n# 17.
