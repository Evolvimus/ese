This article highlights several factors that Goldman Sachs uses, in combination, to make credit decisions but doesn't include all of the details, factors, scores or other information used to make those decisions.\n - If you apply for Apple Card and your application is approved, there's no impact to your credit score1 until you accept your offer. If you accept your offer, a hard inquiry is made. A hard inquiry may impact your credit score. If your application is declined or you reject your offer, your credit score isn't affected by the soft inquiry associated with your application.\n - If your application is declined, learn what you can do to try and improve your next application.\n - If you combine accounts for Apple Card Family,2 some of the credit factors mentioned above may be considered for both co-owners3 when evaluating a combined credit limit for a co-owned Apple Card.\n - Personal finance companies, like Credit Karma, might display various credit scores, like TransUnion VantageScore. While these scores can be informative, if they differ from the FICO score used for your Apple Card application, they may not be as predictive of your approval.\nIf you apply for Apple Card and your application is approved, there's no impact to your credit score1 until you accept your offer.

Learn how to lift your credit freeze with TransUnion.\nYou might need to verify your identity with a Driver's license or State-issued Photo ID.\n\n# Conditions that might cause your application to be declined\nWhen assessing your ability to pay back debt, Goldman Sachs considers multiple conditions before making a decision on your Apple Card application.\nIf any of the following conditions apply, Goldman Sachs might not be able to approve your Apple Card application.\nIf you're behind on debt obligations or have previously been behind\n - You are currently past due or have recently been past due on a debt obligation.5\n - Your checking account was closed by a bank (for example, because you repeatedly spent more than your available balance).\n - You have two or more non-medical debt collections that are recently past due.\nYou are currently past due or have recently been past due on a debt obligation.5\nYour checking account was closed by a bank (for example, because you repeatedly spent more than your available balance).\nYou have two or more non-medical debt collections that are recently past due.\nIf you have negative public records\n - A tax lien was placed on your assets (for example, due to a failure to pay sufficient taxes on time).\n - A judgment was passed against you (for example, due to litigation).\n - You have had a recent bankruptcy.\n - Your property has been recently repossessed.\nA tax lien was placed on your assets (for example, due to a failure to pay sufficient taxes on time).\nA judgment was passed against you (for example, due to litigation).\nYou have had a recent bankruptcy.\nYour property has been recently repossessed.\nIf you're heavily in debt or your income is insufficient to make debt payments\n - You need more disposable income after you pay existing debt obligations.\n - Your debt obligations represent a high percentage of your monthly income (for example, your unsecured debt obligations, such as loans that aren't backed by collateral, are 50% or more of your total income).\n - You have fully utilized all of your credit card lines in the last three months and recently opened many new credit accounts.\nYou need more disposable income after you pay existing debt obligations.\nYour debt obligations represent a high percentage of your monthly income (for example, your unsecured debt obligations, such as loans that aren't backed by collateral, are 50% or more of your total income).\nYou have fully utilized all of your credit card lines in the last three months and recently opened many new credit accounts.\nIf you frequently apply for credit cards or loans\nYou have a high number of recent applications for credit.\nIf your credit score is low\nGoldman Sachs evaluates your Apple Card application using TransUnion and other credit bureaus. If your credit score is low (for example, if your FICO® Score 9 is lower than 600),6 Goldman Sachs might be unable to approve your Apple Card application.\n\n# Why your credit score is used\nCredit scores can indicate how you use and pay off debt.\n\n# How credit scores are determined\nInformation found in your credit report is used to determine your credit scores, which might include the following:\n - Your history of debt payments\n - Hard inquiries7 on your credit score from new credit applications\n - The amount of debt you currently have on your credit accounts\n - The age of your credit accounts\n - The amount and type of loan accounts you have open\n - The percentage of available credit you've utilized\n - If and when you had a foreclosure, declared bankruptcy, or had debt sent to collections\nYour history of debt payments\nHard inquiries7 on your credit score from new credit applications\nThe amount of debt you currently have on your credit accounts\nThe age of your credit accounts\nThe amount and type of loan accounts you have open\nThe percentage of available credit you've utilized\nIf and when you had a foreclosure, declared bankruptcy, or had debt sent to collections\nIt's common to see varying credit scores when you look at different sources. Credit Karma and other services might display different credit scores, like TransUnion VantageScore, which is different from the TransUnion FICO® Score 9 that's used for your Apple Card application.\nYour credit report and the timing of when your credit score is updated can affect your credit score.\nBy law, you're allowed to get a free annual copy of your credit report and file a dispute with TransUnion if you find an error.\nLearn about credit scores from TransUnion.\n\n# What you can do if your application is approved with insufficient credit or it's declined\nIf your application is declined, a message with an explanation is sent to the primary email address associated with the Apple ID you used to apply for Apple Card. The message might show your credit score. If information provided by a credit bureau contributed to your application being declined, you can request a free copy of your credit report from that credit bureau using the instructions in the email you receive.\nIf you have a freeze on your credit report, you need to temporarily lift the freeze before you apply for Apple Card. Learn how to lift your credit freeze with TransUnion.\n\n# If your application is declined because your identification information couldn't be verified\nMake sure your name, address, and other information on your Apple Card application are correct. If you find inaccurate information, re-enter the information as needed.\nIf you are asked to verify with an ID, follow these steps:\n - Make sure there is nothing between your device's camera and your ID that could obscure any part of it.\n - Check that the Date of Birth, Last Name, and Address on the ID match the information you entered for your Apple Card application.8\n - Make sure the ID hasn't expired.\nMake sure there is nothing between your device's camera and your ID that could obscure any part of it.\nCheck that the Date of Birth, Last Name, and Address on the ID match the information you entered for your Apple Card application.8\nMake sure the ID hasn't expired.\nAfter you complete these steps, submit your application again. If your application is declined again for the same reason, contact an Apple Card Specialist at Goldman Sachs.\nYour credit score won't be affected if you are declined or don't accept your offer. However, it might be impacted if your application is approved and you accept your offer.\nYou can apply for Apple Card again but might receive the same decision.\nIf you want to receive a different decision on your application when you apply again, you should review your credit report to see if you have conditions that might result in a declined application and then check for these common errors in your credit report.\n\n# If you get an invitation to enroll in Path to Apple Card\nLearn about Path to Apple Card, why you were invited, and how enrollment can help you get approved for Apple Card later.\n\n# If you're approved but your credit limit isn't enough to buy a device with Apple Card Installments\nYou can apply for Apple Card when you buy a new iPhone, iPad, Mac, or other eligible Apple product with Apple Card Installments. If your application is approved with insufficient credit to cover the cost of the device you want to buy, you can choose a different device that's covered by your credit limit, choose a different payment method, or use Apple's Trade-in program.\n\n# How your initial credit limit is determined\nTo determine your initial credit limit, Goldman Sachs assesses your ability to pay using your income and the minimum payment amounts associated with your existing debt.\nIn addition, Goldman Sachs uses many of the same factors that are used to assess whether your application is approved or declined, including your credit score and the amount of credit you utilize on your existing credit lines.\nLearn how you can request a credit limit increase.\n\n# Why your application is pending or in review\nGoldman Sachs might need more time to review some applications, or request more information to verify your identity.

You can learn more about Apple satellite features, including availability, here:\n - Emergency SOS via satellite connects you to emergency responders\n - Roadside Assistance via satellite connects you to a roadside assistance provider\n - Messages via satellite lets you message friends and family right from the Messages app\n - Find My via satellite lets you update your location\nEmergency SOS via satellite connects you to emergency responders\nRoadside Assistance via satellite connects you to a roadside assistance provider\nMessages via satellite lets you message friends and family right from the Messages app\nFind My via satellite lets you update your location\nSatellite network for Apple satellite features provided by Globalstar, Inc. and its affiliates or third-party network providers.\nSatellite connectivity for Apple satellite features isn't offered on iPhone models purchased in Armenia, Belarus, China mainland, Kyrgyzstan, Kazakhstan, and Russia. For iPhone models purchased in Hong Kong and Macao, satellite connectivity is offered only on iPhone 16e and later.\n\n# How satellite connection works on iPhone\nSatellites move rapidly, have low bandwidth, and are located hundreds of miles away from Earth. So, when you use a satellite connection, the experience is different than sending or receiving a message via cellular:\n - In ideal conditions with a direct view of the sky and the horizon, a message might take 30 seconds to send. It might take over a minute to send under trees with light or medium foliage.\n - If you're under heavy foliage or surrounded by other obstructions, you might not be able to connect to a satellite.\n - Connection times can also be impacted by your surroundings, the length of your message, and the status and availability of the satellite network.\nIn ideal conditions with a direct view of the sky and the horizon, a message might take 30 seconds to send. It might take over a minute to send under trees with light or medium foliage.\nIf you're under heavy foliage or surrounded by other obstructions, you might not be able to connect to a satellite.\nConnection times can also be impacted by your surroundings, the length of your message, and the status and availability of the satellite network.\nTo use satellite connectivity, your iPhone must have compatible software. Before you go somewhere with no cellular and Wi-Fi coverage, you should update to the latest version of iOS.\nApple satellite features are included for free for two years with the activation of an iPhone 14 or later (all models). Your carrier may also provide satellite features.\n\n# Connect to a satellite with your iPhone\nStarting in iOS 18, the Connection Assistant helps you access satellite features and connect to a satellite when you are somewhere with no cellular and Wi-Fi coverage. When you open Connection Assistant, your iPhone provides onscreen instructions to connect.\n\n# Open Connection Assistant\nYou can open the Connection Assistant in Control Center or in the Settings app:\n - In Control Center: Swipe down from the top right corner of your iPhone to open Control Center, then tap the Cellular button on the right. Tap Satellite, then choose a satellite feature.\n - In the Settings app: Open Settings, then tap Satellite and choose a satellite feature.\nIn Control Center: Swipe down from the top right corner of your iPhone to open Control Center, then tap the Cellular button on the right. Tap Satellite, then choose a satellite feature.\nIn the Settings app: Open Settings, then tap Satellite and choose a satellite feature.\nIf you have cellular or Wi-Fi coverage, the Satellite option in Settings won't appear and the Satellite option in Control Center opens the Satellite Connection Demo.\n\n# How to connect to a satellite\n - Be outside with a clear view of the sky and the horizon.\n - Be aware that trees with light foliage might slow down the connection. Dense foliage, hills or mountains, canyons, and tall structures might block the connection.\n - Hold your iPhone naturally in your hand. You don't need to raise your arm or hold your phone up, but don't put it in a pocket or backpack.\n - If you need to turn left or right or move to avoid a blocked signal, your iPhone provides onscreen instructions.\n - The satellite connection can be maintained even if your phone screen is locked.\n - Satellite connectivity might not work in places above 62° latitude, such as northern parts of Alaska.\nBe outside with a clear view of the sky and the horizon.\nBe aware that trees with light foliage might slow down the connection.

You need to be outside, on relatively open terrain, with a clear view of the sky. Trees with light foliage might slow down the connection and dense foliage might block it. Hills or mountains, canyons, and tall structures can also block the connection.\nIf you don't have Location Services turned on for Satellite Connection, you're prompted to turn it on before you start the demo.\n - To open Control Center, swipe down from the top right corner of your iPhone.\n - Tap the Cellular button on the right of Control Center.\n - Tap Satellite, then tap Try Demo:To learn how to connect to satellite, tap Try Connecting to Satellite.To learn how Emergency SOS via satellite works, tap Try Emergency SOS.You can also tap a satellite feature to learn more about it.\n - To learn how to connect to satellite, tap Try Connecting to Satellite.\n - To learn how Emergency SOS via satellite works, tap Try Emergency SOS.\n - You can also tap a satellite feature to learn more about it.\n - Follow the onscreen instructions to practice connecting your iPhone to a satellite.\nTo open Control Center, swipe down from the top right corner of your iPhone.\nTap the Cellular button on the right of Control Center.\nTap Satellite, then tap Try Demo:\n - To learn how to connect to satellite, tap Try Connecting to Satellite.\n - To learn how Emergency SOS via satellite works, tap Try Emergency SOS.\n - You can also tap a satellite feature to learn more about it.\nTo learn how to connect to satellite, tap Try Connecting to Satellite.\nTo learn how Emergency SOS via satellite works, tap Try Emergency SOS.\nYou can also tap a satellite feature to learn more about it.\nFollow the onscreen instructions to practice connecting your iPhone to a satellite.\nYou can also open directly to a demo of Emergency SOS via satellite or Messages via satellite:\n - Emergency SOS via satellite: Settings app > Emergency SOS\n - Settings app > Apps > Messages, then scroll down and tap Satellite Connection Demo.\nEmergency SOS via satellite: Settings app > Emergency SOS\nSettings app > Apps > Messages, then scroll down and tap Satellite Connection Demo.\nTo use the demo, you need to be in a country or region where that satellite feature is available. The Emergency SOS via satellite demo does not call emergency services.\n\n# Satellite features and privacy\nWhen you text with Emergency SOS via satellite, your messages are sent in encrypted form, and decrypted by Apple to be passed along to the relevant emergency services dispatcher, or the emergency relay center. Your messages may be retained by emergency service centers and the relay provider to improve their services, and in compliance with applicable laws.\nIn order to route your text messages to a local emergency services organization, and to assist responders in reaching you, your location will be shared with Apple and the relay providers when you use Emergency SOS via satellite.\nWhen you use Roadside Assistance via satellite, your current location will be shared with Apple and the roadside assistance provider temporarily until help arrives, in order to route your message to the roadside assistance provider and assist them in reaching you. After help arrives, location data is no longer shared with Apple and the roadside assistance provider.\nWhen you share your location via satellite in the Find My app, your location is sent in an end-to-end encrypted form and can't be accessed by Apple.\nWhen you use Messages via satellite, your iMessages are end-to-end encrypted, so that nobody other than you and the person that you're messaging with can read them while they're in transit between devices.\nAt all times, information collected by Apple will be treated in accordance with Apple’s Privacy Policy.\n\n# Apple Footer\n - Support\n - Connect to a satellite with your iPhone",

For example, you can wear and use your Apple Watch during activities such as exercise (exposure to sweat is OK), walking in rain, and washing your hands. With Apple Watch Ultra, you can also participate in high-speed water sports and recreational scuba diving up to 40 meters.\n - Apple Watch Series 1 and Apple Watch (1st generation) have a water-resistance rating of IPX7 under IEC standard 60529.\n - Apple Watch Series 2 and later have a water-resistance rating of 50 meters under ISO standard 22810:2010.\n - Apple Watch Ultra and later have a water-resistance rating of 100 meters under ISO standard 22810:2010 and is EN13319-compliant.\n - Apple Watch Series 7 and later are rated IP6X dust resistant.\n - Apple Watch Ultra and later are rated IP6X dust resistant.\n - Magnetic Link, Modern Buckle (with FineWoven), Leather Link, Modern Buckle (with leather), Milanese Loop, Link Bracelet, and Hermès leather and knit bands are not water resistant.\nApple Watch Series 1 and Apple Watch (1st generation) have a water-resistance rating of IPX7 under IEC standard 60529.\nApple Watch Series 2 and later have a water-resistance rating of 50 meters under ISO standard 22810:2010.\nApple Watch Ultra and later have a water-resistance rating of 100 meters under ISO standard 22810:2010 and is EN13319-compliant.\nApple Watch Series 7 and later are rated IP6X dust resistant.\nApple Watch Ultra and later are rated IP6X dust resistant.\nMagnetic Link, Modern Buckle (with FineWoven), Leather Link, Modern Buckle (with leather), Milanese Loop, Link Bracelet, and Hermès leather and knit bands are not water resistant.\n\n# Can I go scuba diving, swimming, or take a shower with my Apple Watch?\nIf you have Apple Watch Ultra or later, you can wear it during recreational scuba diving up to 130 feet (40 meters) and other activities like swimming, showering, and water skiing.*\nApple Watch Series 2 and later can be used for shallow-water activities like swimming in a pool or ocean, but you shouldn't use models other than Apple Watch Ultra or later for diving, water skiing, or other activities involving submersion below shallow depth or high-velocity water.\nApple Watch Series 1 and Apple Watch (1st generation) are splash and water resistant, but submerging these models isn't recommended.\nNot all Apple Watch bands are appropriate for water use. For example, the stainless steel and leather bands aren't water resistant and shouldn't be exposed to liquids.\n* For important information about safety while using Apple Watch Ultra for underwater activities, see Measure underwater temperature, duration, and depth on Apple Watch Ultra in the Apple Watch Ultra User Guide.\n\n# What should I avoid while wearing my Apple Watch?\nWater resistance isn't a permanent condition and can diminish over time. Apple Watch can't be rechecked or resealed for water resistance. The following can affect the water resistance of your Apple Watch and should be avoided:\n - Dropping Apple Watch or subjecting it to other impacts\n - Exposing Apple Watch to soap or soapy water (for example, while showering or bathing)\n - Exposing Apple Watch to perfume, solvents, detergent, acids or acidic foods, insect repellent, lotions, sunscreen, oil, or hair dye\n - Exposing Apple Watch models other than Apple Watch Ultra or later to high-velocity water (for example, while water skiing)\n - Wearing Apple Watch while cliff diving or high diving\n - Wearing Apple Watch in a steam room\n - Wearing Apple Watch models other than Apple Watch Ultra or later in a sauna\n - Wearing Apple Watch Ultra or later in a sauna above 55° C (130° F)\nDropping Apple Watch or subjecting it to other impacts\nExposing Apple Watch to soap or soapy water (for example, while showering or bathing)\nExposing Apple Watch to perfume, solvents, detergent, acids or acidic foods, insect repellent, lotions, sunscreen, oil, or hair dye\nExposing Apple Watch models other than Apple Watch Ultra or later to high-velocity water (for example, while water skiing)\nWearing Apple Watch while cliff diving or high diving\nWearing Apple Watch in a steam room\nWearing Apple Watch models other than Apple Watch Ultra or later in a sauna\nWearing Apple Watch Ultra or later in a sauna above 55° C (130° F)\nWhile the above should be avoided, if your Apple Watch comes in contact accidentally with soaps, shampoos, conditioners, lotions, perfumes, solvents, detergent, acids or acidic foods, insect repellent, sunscreen, oil, hair dye, or any substance other than water, it should be cleaned with fresh warm water and dried with a lint-free cloth. Chemicals found in these items could negatively affect water seals and acoustic membranes.\n\n# What should I do if my Apple Watch gets wet?\nTo remove water from your Apple Watch, wipe it off with a nonabrasive, lint-free cloth. Don't use heat, compressed air, or sprays. Clean and dry your Apple Watch, the band, and your skin after workouts or heavy sweating. After swimming, gently rinse Apple Watch Series 2 and later under lightly running, warm, fresh water. Dry Apple Watch and the band thoroughly afterwards. Learn more about cleaning your Apple Watch.\nIf your Apple Watch gets wet and its speaker sounds muffled, follow the steps below. Don't insert anything into the openings—for example, the microphone or speaker ports—and don't shake the watch to remove water. Allowing your Apple Watch to charge overnight might speed up evaporation.\nOn Apple Watch Series 3 and later, measurements from the barometric altimeter might be less accurate if water gets into the air vent (for example, during swimming). Normal altimeter performance returns after the water has evaporated.\n\n# Apple Watch Series 2 and later\nWhen you start a swimming workout, your Apple Watch automatically locks the screen with Water Lock to avoid accidental taps. And if you have Apple Watch Ultra or later, you can have it turn on Water Lock automatically when it's submerged to a depth of 10cm or lower. When you finish, press and hold* the Digital Crown to unlock the screen and clear any water from your Apple Watch. A series of tones plays to clear any water that remains in the speaker.\nTo clear water from Apple Watch manually, press the side button to open Control Center (for watchOS 9 or earlier, touch and hold the bottom of the screen, then swipe up). Tap Water Lock, then press and hold the Digital Crown to unlock the screen and clear water from the speaker.\n* If your Apple Watch has watchOS 8 or earlier, rotate the Digital Crown instead of pressing it.\n\n# Apple Watch Series 1 or earlier\nCheck to see if water is in the microphone or speaker by placing the device, speaker-side down, on a nonabrasive, lint-free cloth to see if any water drips out. Water in the port can degrade speaker or microphone performance until it evaporates completely.\n\n# Related topics\n\n# Apple Footer\n - Support\n - About Apple Watch water resistance",

Learn how to add emergency contacts.\nEmergency SOS requires a satellite connection, cellular connection, or Wi-Fi calling with an internet connection from your Apple Watch or nearby iPhone. You can use cellular models of Apple Watch to make an emergency call in many locations, provided that cellular service is available. Some cellular networks may not accept an emergency call from your Apple Watch if your Apple Watch isn’t activated, if it isn’t compatible with or configured to operate on a particular cellular network, or if isn’t set up for cellular service, or if the cellular network does not support emergency calling over IMS.\nLearn more about Apple Watch GPS + Cellular.\nIn some countries and regions, you might need to choose the emergency service that you need. For example, in China mainland you can choose police, fire, or ambulance. And if you have Apple Watch Series 5 or later (GPS + Cellular), Apple Watch SE or later (GPS + Cellular), or any model of Ultra, your watch can also call local emergency services when you're traveling in other countries or regions.\n\n# How to call emergency services on your Apple Watch\n - Press and hold your watch's side button (the button below the Digital Crown) until the Emergency Call slider appears. On Apple Watch Ultra models, you can also press and hold the Action button.\n - Drag the Emergency Call slider to start the call immediately. Or you can keep holding the side button; after a countdown, your watch calls emergency services automatically.\nPress and hold your watch's side button (the button below the Digital Crown) until the Emergency Call slider appears. On Apple Watch Ultra models, you can also press and hold the Action button.\nDrag the Emergency Call slider to start the call immediately. Or you can keep holding the side button; after a countdown, your watch calls emergency services automatically.\n\n# Use Crash Detection and Fall Detection to call for help\nIf you have Apple Watch Series 8 or later, Apple Watch SE (2nd generation), or Apple Watch Ultra or later with the latest version of watchOS, your device can call emergency services and send a message to your emergency contacts when a severe car crash is detected. Learn more about using Crash Detection on Apple Watch to call for help in an accident.\nFall Detection on Apple Watch Series 4 or later and Apple Watch SE or later can connect you to emergency services when a hard fall is detected. Learn how to use Fall Detection on Apple Watch.\n\n# Turn off automatic dialing\nYou can change your settings so that holding the side button won't call emergency services automatically:\n - Open the Apple Watch app on your iPhone, then tap the My Watch tab.\n - Tap Emergency SOS.\n - Turn off Hold Side Button to Dial.\nOpen the Apple Watch app on your iPhone, then tap the My Watch tab.\nTap Emergency SOS.\nTurn off Hold Side Button to Dial.\nIf you turn off this setting, you can still use the Emergency Call slider to make a call.\n\n# End a call that you started accidentally\nIf you start the Emergency SOS countdown by accident, just release the side button.\nIf the call has been made, but you don’t need emergency services, don’t hang up. Wait until a responder answers, then explain that you don’t need help. After that, your watch asks if you still want to send a text message to your emergency contacts. Tap No if you want to cancel the text.\n\n# Stop sharing your location\nAfter your emergency call, your Apple Watch will remind you every four hours that your location is being shared with your emergency contacts. Tap Stop Sharing in the notification to stop sharing your location.\n\n# International emergency calling\nApple Watch Series 5 and later (GPS + Cellular), Apple Watch SE and later (GPS + Cellular), and all models of Ultra can call local emergency services when you're in another country or region. When you start an Emergency SOS call while abroad, your watch connects to local emergency services, but it may not be able to send your location or a text message to your emergency contacts.\nIn some countries and regions, international emergency calling works even if you haven't set up cellular service on the watch. Learn which countries and regions are supported.\nJust like when you use Emergency SOS in your home country or region, your iPhone needs to be nearby if your Apple Watch isn't a cellular model.\n\n# Set up other emergency features\n - Use Crash Detection on your Apple Watch to call for help in an accident\n - Use Emergency Call waypoints on Apple Watch\n - Use Fall Detection with Apple Watch\n - Use Emergency SOS on your iPhone\n - Set up your Medical ID in the Health app on your iPhone\nUse Crash Detection on your Apple Watch to call for help in an accident\nUse Emergency Call waypoints on Apple Watch\nUse Fall Detection with Apple Watch\nUse Emergency SOS on your iPhone\nSet up your Medical ID in the Health app on your iPhone\n - Location sharing with emergency services varies by country and region, and may not be available everywhere.\n - If you use Emergency SOS, your emergency contacts will not be automatically notified if the Messages app is not the selected Text Messaging App or is deleted.\nLocation sharing with emergency services varies by country and region, and may not be available everywhere.\nIf you use Emergency SOS, your emergency contacts will not be automatically notified if the Messages app is not the selected Text Messaging App or is deleted.\n\n# Need more help?\nTell us more about what's happening, and we’ll suggest what you can do next.\nGet suggestions\n\n# Related topics\n\n# Apple Footer\n - Support\n - Use Emergency SOS on your Apple Watch",

See the support-related materials included with your Apple product or visit the AppleCare Products page for more information.\n\n# How does Apple define “support incident?”\nApple defines a support incident as a specific, discrete issue that can be addressed by isolating its origin to a single cause. Apple, in its sole discretion, will determine what constitutes a support incident. A support incident has reached resolution when the customer receives one of the following:\n - Information that resolves the issue\n - Information on how to obtain a software solution that will resolve the issue\n - Notice that the issue is caused by a known, unresolved issue or an incompatibility issue with the supported product\n - Information that identifies the issue as being resolved by upgrading to a newer release of the supported product\n - Notice that the issue has been identified as a hardware equipment issue\n - Information that isolates issue to a third-party product, not supported by Apple\n\n# Apple Footer\n - Support\n - Complimentary Support\n\n# Product Support\n - iPhone Support\n - Mac Support\n - iPad Support\n - Watch Support\n - Apple Vision Pro Support\n - AirPods Support\n - TV Support\n - Support Site Map\n\n# Service and Repair\n - Apple Repair Options\n - Service and Repair Information\n - AppleCare Products\n - Hardware Warranties\n - Software License Agreements\n - Complimentary Support\n\n# Resources\n - My Support\n - Product Documentation\n - Apple Support Videos\n - Accessibility\n\n# Connect\n - Contact Us\n - Support app\n - Apple Communities\n - @AppleSupport",

If your credit score is low (for example, if your FICO® Score 9 is lower than 600),6 Goldman Sachs might be unable to approve your Apple Card application.\n\n# Why your credit score is used\nCredit scores can indicate how you use and pay off debt.\n\n# How credit scores are determined\nInformation found in your credit report is used to determine your credit scores, which might include the following:\n - Your history of debt payments\n - Hard inquiries7 on your credit score from new credit applications\n - The amount of debt you currently have on your credit accounts\n - The age of your credit accounts\n - The amount and type of loan accounts you have open\n - The percentage of available credit you've utilized\n - If and when you had a foreclosure, declared bankruptcy, or had debt sent to collections\nYour history of debt payments\nHard inquiries7 on your credit score from new credit applications\nThe amount of debt you currently have on your credit accounts\nThe age of your credit accounts\nThe amount and type of loan accounts you have open\nThe percentage of available credit you've utilized\nIf and when you had a foreclosure, declared bankruptcy, or had debt sent to collections\nIt's common to see varying credit scores when you look at different sources.

The message might show your credit score. If information provided by a credit bureau contributed to your application being declined, you can request a free copy of your credit report from that credit bureau using the instructions in the email you receive.\nIf you have a freeze on your credit report, you need to temporarily lift the freeze before you apply for Apple Card. Learn how to lift your credit freeze with TransUnion.\n\n# If your application is declined because your identification information couldn't be verified\nMake sure your name, address, and other information on your Apple Card application are correct. If you find inaccurate information, re-enter the information as needed.\nIf you are asked to verify with an ID, follow these steps:\n - Make sure there is nothing between your device's camera and your ID that could obscure any part of it.\n - Check that the Date of Birth, Last Name, and Address on the ID match the information you entered for your Apple Card application.8\n - Make sure the ID hasn't expired.\nMake sure there is nothing between your device's camera and your ID that could obscure any part of it.\nCheck that the Date of Birth, Last Name, and Address on the ID match the information you entered for your Apple Card application.8\nMake sure the ID hasn't expired.\nAfter you complete these steps, submit your application again. If your application is declined again for the same reason, contact an Apple Card Specialist at Goldman Sachs.\nYour credit score won't be affected if you are declined or don't accept your offer. However, it might be impacted if your application is approved and you accept your offer.\nYou can apply for Apple Card again but might receive the same decision.\nIf you want to receive a different decision on your application when you apply again, you should review your credit report to see if you have conditions that might result in a declined application and then check for these common errors in your credit report.\n\n# If you get an invitation to enroll in Path to Apple Card\nLearn about Path to Apple Card, why you were invited, and how enrollment can help you get approved for Apple Card later.\n\n# If you're approved but your credit limit isn't enough to buy a device with Apple Card Installments\nYou can apply for Apple Card when you buy a new iPhone, iPad, Mac, or other eligible Apple product with Apple Card Installments. If your application is approved with insufficient credit to cover the cost of the device you want to buy, you can choose a different device that's covered by your credit limit, choose a different payment method, or use Apple's Trade-in program.\n\n# How your initial credit limit is determined\nTo determine your initial credit limit, Goldman Sachs assesses your ability to pay using your income and the minimum payment amounts associated with your existing debt.\nIn addition, Goldman Sachs uses many of the same factors that are used to assess whether your application is approved or declined, including your credit score and the amount of credit you utilize on your existing credit lines.\nLearn how you can request a credit limit increase.\n\n# Why your application is pending or in review\nGoldman Sachs might need more time to review some applications, or request more information to verify your identity.

You can even co-own the account with one other person.\n\n# About Apple Card Family\nApple Card Family1 lets you co-own your Apple Card account with one member of your Family Sharing group. You can share your credit line with a co-owner2 and build credit together as equals3. You can even invite another Apple Card owner to combine credit limits4 with you and form one co-owned account. You can also share your Apple Card with members of your Family Sharing group, including teens and adults. Everyone on the shared account can use Apple Card and view their spending. Account owners and co-owners can see a participant's5 activity, set transaction limits, and more. And there's a single monthly bill.\nSix people — including you — can be on a shared Apple Card account. You can invite up to five members of your Family Sharing group to join and one of those five can be an account co-owner. Participants must be 13 years or older and account co-owners must be 18 years or older.\n\n# What account owners and co-owners can do on a shared Apple Card\n - They share full responsibility for the account balance and all payments, even if one account co-owner does not pay.\n - They can build credit together equally, which means that account owners and co-owners are each reported in their own name. Credit reporting includes positive and negative payment history, credit utilization, and additional information. Card usage and payment history might impact each account co-owners credit score differently because each individual's credit history will include information that's unique to them.\n - They can get unlimited Daily Cash6 back on their own transactions.\n - They can add or remove participants and order a titanium Apple Card for participants who are under 18 years old.\n - They can view participant activity and account co-owner activity.\n - They can set transaction limits7 for participants, lock a participant's ability to spend, and receive notifications on participants spending.\n - They can request a credit limit increase.\n - They can close the shared Apple Card account at any time, but are still responsible for paying any remaining balance.8\nThey share full responsibility for the account balance and all payments, even if one account co-owner does not pay.\nThey can build credit together equally, which means that account owners and co-owners are each reported in their own name.

Information about the Apple Card Family account, such as payment history and credit utilization, is reported to credit bureaus and shown in credit bureau reports for account owners and co-owners. This information might also be shown in credit bureau reports for a participant if they're being reported on the Apple Card Family account as an authorized user. Being credit reported can assist with building credit history for account co-owners and participants. Generally, accounts that have been established for a while, show consistent on-time payments, and have low balances (e.g. below 30% of the total credit limit), might result in a more positive credit impact.\n\n# Requirements\n - Own a compatible iPhone or iPad with the latest version of iOS or iPadOS, or a compatible Apple Watch with the latest version of watchOS.\n - The account owner must have an Apple Card account.\n - Set up Family Sharing or be part of a Family Sharing group.\n - Account co-owners must be 18 years or older and a member of your Family Sharing group.\n - Participants must be 13 years or older and a member of your Family Sharing group.\n - Make sure that your device region is set to the United States.\nOwn a compatible iPhone or iPad with the latest version of iOS or iPadOS, or a compatible Apple Watch with the latest version of watchOS.\nThe account owner must have an Apple Card account.\nSet up Family Sharing or be part of a Family Sharing group.\nAccount co-owners must be 18 years or older and a member of your Family Sharing group.\nParticipants must be 13 years or older and a member of your Family Sharing group.\nMake sure that your device region is set to the United States.\n\n# Invite an Apple Card Family participant or account co-owner\n - Open the Wallet app and tap your Apple Card.\n - Tap the More button, then tap Account Details.\n - Under Apple Card Family, tap Add User, then tap Continue.\n - Select a member of your Family Sharing group.
